## Generating Clusters of species to represent niches

`cluster.Rmd` is a RStudio notebook used to generate three different clusters of species based on their morphology. These clusters are used as a representation of niches and used to analysis niche presence and accumulation/loss within the urban environment.

`cluster.nb.html` is an html representation of the notebook.
`cluster.schema.yaml` contains details of the two files used; `taxonomy.csv` for species morphology input, and `taxonomic_trait_clusters.csv` for cluster output.
The clustering is used to generate three different configurations, one used for the main analysis, one with half the number of clusters, and another with twice the number of clusters.
